## Introduction:

This is one of the projects done during the [IronHack](https://www.ironhack.com/en) Data Analytics bootcamp. 
The current project is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0121). A dataset with diamond characteristics and their price was provided, and the objective was to predict diamond' prices regarding their features.


## Data:

Two datasets were provided, "train.csv" and "test.csv". The first one contained diamond features and the price, and had to be used to train the model. The second one only had diamond features and had to be used to predict the diamond prices regarding their characteristics.
The features included in the dataset were: carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, x, y, z and price.
A previous research was carried out to understand the importance of the diamond characteristics, in the [American Gem Society](https://www.americangemsociety.org/buying-diamonds-with-confidence/ags-diamond-grading-system/#:~:text=Very%20Slightly%20Included%20diamonds%20with,or%20VS2)%20have%20minor%20inclusions.&text=Slightly%20Included%20diamonds%20with%20a%20clarity%20grade%20of%205%2C%206,visible%20to%20the%20unaided%20eye.) website are provided some interesting tables to understand the different color, cut and clarity parameters.

The following Python libraries were used:
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
- [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
